        Thanks for your interest in establishing a translation community for the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack! 

        Translations are community-owned efforts that bring together multiple contributors including translators, reviewers, and community members. This form helps us establish a collaborative translation community for your target language.

        **Community Approach:** The community owns the translations, not individuals or groups. Multiple people can contribute, take over, or maintain translations over time, creating a sustainable and collaborative effort.

        **Title Format:** When creating this issue, please update the title to format: `üåê [LANGUAGE_CODE] Language Name Translation Community`
        - Examples: `üåê [pl] Polish Translation Community`, `üåê [es-419] Espa√±ol Latino Translation Community`

        **Before submitting:** Please check existing issues and discussions to ensure this language community is not already being established. We encourage joining existing efforts rather than creating competing translations.
