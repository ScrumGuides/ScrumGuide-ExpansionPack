Jeff Sutherland, the inventor and Co-Creator of Scrum and Scrum@Scale has worked with thousands of companies deploying Scrum and recently launched two global trainer programs for Registered Scrum Trainers and Registered Scrum@Scale Trainers in addition to creating independent companies starting with Scrum Inc Japan. He is Founder and Managing Director of Tesla Investment Holdings LLC which is an investment fund that coinvests with OpenView Venture Partners and CompanyOn Ventures. As President of JVS Management Inc he supports the investment fund and portfolio of companies. All organizations maximize impact by implementing Scrum@Scale and investing in agile companies.

Jeff started his career as a fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force where he achieved Top Gun status in 1967 and flew 100 combat missions over North Vietnam.

After 11 years as a pilot, he joined the faculty of the University of Colorado Medical School where he received his Doctoral degree. As Asst. Prof.of Radiology, Biometrics, and Preventive Medicine he co-founded the Center for Vitamins and Cancer Research under the sponsorship of Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling and for eight years was the Principle Investigator of a National Cancer Center research grant that ran all IT programs and research for the Colorado Regional Cancer Center.

In 1983 he joined a banking company that operated 150 banks throughout North America where he was VP of Advanced Systems and General Manager of their ATM Business Unit. Noticing that waterfall processes at the bank were not working, he implemented the first prototype of Scrum@Scale for organizational transformation of a business unit.

He has been VP of Engineering and CTO or CEO of eleven software companies. In the first four companies he prototyped Scrum and in 1993 in the fifth company created Scrum as we now see it used in 74% of Agile software companies in over 100 countries. He was a signatory of the Agile Manifesto in 2001.

In 2006, working as Senior Advisor to OpenView Venture Partners and their portfolio companies, Sutherland established his own company, Scrum, Inc. now recognized as the premiere source of Scrum Training in the world. His latest book, Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time," describes how he used his background and experience to create the most widely used Agile practice in industry today.
