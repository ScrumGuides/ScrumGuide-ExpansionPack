# Scrum _Expanded_ on One Page {#scrum-expanded-on-one-page}

Scrum is described in the [2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/) (40). Scrum is a lightweight framework for addressing complex (30-35) work, particularly in Product discovery, development, delivery, and value realization. Scrum is based on empirical process control (decisions informed by evidence) and lean thinking (reducing waste and focusing on the flow of value) (63). Scrum is purposefully incomplete, guiding interactions rather than prescribing detailed recipes.

**Why Use Scrum?**  
Scrum enables Scrum Teams to identify, represent, or measure emergence (71), embrace uncertainty, respond to change, deliver and validate value frequently, and continuously improve. Scrum fosters collaboration, accountability, and evidence-informed decision-making, fostering the best possible outcomes in a rapidly changing environment. Self-managing Scrum Teams, organized around value, are crucial for creative problem-solving and opportunity capture; non-self-managing Scrum Teams hinder the ability to deal with complexity (30-35). Self-managing Scrum Teams are not to be confused with individual self-management.

**Elements of Scrum**

1\. Scrum Theory: Built on three pillars:

- Transparency – Making work and value visible for Inspection.
- Inspection – Regularly assessing progress and outcomes for Adaptation.
- Adaptation – Adjusting plans informed by insights and feedback.

2\. Scrum Values:

- _Focus_, _Openness_, _Courage_, _Commitment_, and _Respect_ enable effective teamwork; they support trust.

3\. _Roles_ / Accountabilities:

- Scrum Team – A small, self-managing, cross-functional, cognitively diverse team consisting of:
  - Product Owner – Maximizes long-term value, engages Stakeholders, and manages the Product Backlog.
  - Scrum Master – Guides the Scrum adoption, removes impediments, and fosters continuous improvement.
  - Product Developers – Deliver Increments every Sprint through their cross-functional capabilities.
- _Stakeholder \- an entity, individual, or group interested in, affected by, or impacting inputs, activities, and outcomes with a direct or indirect interest inside or outside the organization, its Products, or services._
  - _Supporter, a Stakeholder type – Fosters the climate and environment and participates as requested._
  - _AI – As a tool or also a possible Product Developer, but not to be entirely trusted yet._

4\. Scrum Events & Activities

- Scrum operates in Sprints (iterations of determinate length _up to four weeks_) with four timeboxed events:
- Sprint Planning – Define the Sprint Goal and plan the work.
- Daily Scrum – Product Developers align daily on progress toward the Sprint Goal or Product Goal.
- Sprint Review – Inspect the Increment, value, and marketplace, and adapt the Product Backlog.
- Sprint Retrospective – Reflect and improve the Scrum Team.
- Refinement – Clarify upcoming or selected work, formally (_as an optional event_) or informally

5\. Scrum Artifacts & Commitments

- _Product & Definition of Outcome Done – Product and valuable outcomes that provide evidence of realized benefits._
- Increment & Definition of Output Done – A potentially valuable, releasable candidate update for the Product.
- Product Backlog & Product Goal – the ordered (sequenced) list of work to achieve a medium-term, more strategic objective.
- Sprint Backlog & Sprint Goal – Selected Product Backlog Items and a plan for the Sprint, short-term objective.
