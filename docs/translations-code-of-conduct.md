# Code of Conduct for Scrum Guide Expansion Pack Translators

Translators of the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack and its associated materials do our community an invaluable service and are greatly appreciated. This document outlines translator expectations and standards to ensure that translation work is of the highest quality and serves the best interests of the communities served by the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack.

Official translators must agree to this code of conduct before translating, re-translating, or continuing to translate any written materials associated with the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack.

Suggestions to improve this code of conduct can be submitted using discussions at [https://scrumexpansion.org](https://scrumexpansion.org).

# 1\. Glossary

_Translation_ refers to any translated document from the official website(s) publishing the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack, currently the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack website [https://scrumexpansion.org](https://scrumexpansion.org).

A _translator_ is an individual person who facilitates/creates/amends/reviews the translation(s) of documents at the official website(s) for accessing Scrum Guide Expansion Pack, currently the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack’s website [https://scrumexpansion.org](https://scrumexpansion.org).

The administrators of the official website(s) for accessing Scrum Guide Expansion Pack, currently the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack website [https://scrumexpansion.org](https://scrumexpansion.org), act as the guardian for the translations, hereafter referred to as the _translation guardian_.

# 2\. General Rules

1. The community owns the translations, not the groups or individuals who perform the translation(s). Therefore, other groups or individuals can take over the translation(s) for subsequent updates without requesting permission from the previous translators, subject to written permission from the translation guardian.
2. The translator must verify that the translation appears as expected in HTML, Markdown, and PDF formats. For images, the translator should use the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format if applicable.
3. Translators are expected to follow the written GitHub processes on the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack website.
4. The translation guardian or delegate will publish translations in both markdown/HTML and high-quality PDF formats for electronic distribution (so that hyperlinks work).
5. Translate the main part of the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack until the beginning of the appendix at a minimum. Translating the appendix is optional.
6. The translation should render no material changes to content (such as changes in meaning, emphasis, or inattention to nuance); this includes the acknowledgment section.
7. Translation can be presented in side-by-side paragraph format (to enhance reader trust), fully translated, or both (in a single document). If both side-by-side and full translations are in the same document, the side-by-side translation must appear first.
8. Copyright information and creative commons collection or license information in the original document must not be altered and, therefore, should not be translated.
9. The translation must include a _Translator Acknowledgement_ section and a _Change_ _Log,_ as specified in Section 6 of this Code of Conduct. The Translator Acknowledgement section must include details for the current translation version and should consist of previous translator groups, subject to their permission.
10. The translation guardian reserves the right to remove acknowledgments or translations should they determine that the group of translators, or individuals therein, bring the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack into disrepute.
11. During translation, reviewers should submit all feedback through constructive and respectful comments to help ensure that it is not ignored or diminished. Alternatively, reviewers can provide audio or video feedback.
12. Translators, like everyone else, are welcome to suggest a change(s) to the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack, by following the Github process on scrumexpansion.org.
13. One translation per language is preferred. There are some acceptable exceptions due to regional differences.
14. A translator who, in the eyes of the translation guardian, demonstrates a breach of the Scrum Values or the three pillars for Scrum Empirical Process Control as described in the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack will receive a private written warning from the translation guardian.
15. A translator who, in the eyes of the translation guardian, for the 2nd or 3rd time, demonstrates a breach of the Scrum Values or the three pillars for Scrum Empirical Process Control as described in the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack, will receive a public written warning from the translation guardian. There is no appeals process.
16. The translation guardian reserves the right to remove translators who, in the eyes of the translation guardian, demonstrate four times (or more) a breach of the Scrum Values or the three pillars for Scrum Empirical Process Control as described in the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack. There is no appeals process.

# 3\. Responsibilities of Translation Guardian

1. Notify the translator of any updates to the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack within two business weeks of publication. Translations will go live after the source-document changes, not beforehand.
2. Monitor the consistency of translations.
3. Monitor that translators are abiding by this code of conduct.
4. Approve the beginning of translations.
5. Approve the publication of translations.
6. Publish HTML/Markdown and PDF versions of the approved translations.
7. Resolve queries from translators within four business weeks.
8. Address breaches of the Scrum Values and the three pillars of Scrum’s empirical process control in a timely manner.

# 4\. Responsibilities of Translators

1. Follow the written GitHub process at [scrumexpansion.org](http://scrumexpansion.org) for all translation work.  
   2. It is forbidden to add translator names to the original list of acknowledgments.  
   3. It is forbidden to add to or modify the original Creative Commons licence/attribution.  
   4. Provide the details below in a _Translator Acknowledgement_ section regarding translators and reviewers whose feedback affected the published translation, subject to the consent of each named person. No feedback, no mention, permission or not.

| (optional) Translator Name(s) :             |     |
| :------------------------------------------ | :-- |
| (optional) **Translation Group Name** :     |     |
| (optional) **Primary** ​**Contact Email** : |     |
| (optional) ​​​**Website** :                 |     |
| (optional) **Social media handles:**        |     |

5.  Provide written/audio/video responses from a minimum of five translation reviewers whose first language is the same as the language of translation. Ideally, three reviewers will have Scrum knowledge, and two will not.
6.  Complete the translation within a reasonable timeframe as agreed upon with the translation guardian.
7.  Advise the translation guardian as soon as possible if unable to complete or maintain the translated document.
8.  Respond to requests for needed changes (e.g., translation errors) in a reasonable amount of time as negotiated with the translation guardian.
9.  The translator may not exchange a translation related to the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack for monetary gain.
10. The translation group name, social media handles, and email addresses must not bring the Scrum Guide Expansion Pack into disrepute, as decided by the translation guardian.

# 5\. Reserved Words

Some terms are challenging to translate into other languages, yet readers must understand them.

Given the above, translation is allowed for any instance of the terms below. The American English term must appear in parentheses following the first instance of each translated term. Subsequently, the term may appear in the translated language. The translator may use the American English term throughout if that is the best option.

If the translation of a reserved word/expression is awkward in the translated language, the translator should consult with the translation guardian. Including a glossary at the end of a translated document might be beneficial to readers.

The references section should not be translated

\*\* Not a reserved word, but due care and attention.

# 6\. Change history

A change history log must appear on the last page of a translation documenting the changes from version to version. For example:

| Version number | Significance         | Version date (long date format) |
| :------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| 1.0            | Original translation | 27th February 2022              |

# 7\. Data protection

Scrum Guide Expansion Pack is committed to protecting individual privacy and personal data and expects the same from those providing translation services.

Distribution of names, email addresses, or other personal information acquired during translation without written permission from the person(s) affected is prohibited. Any possibility of a data leak has to be reported to the translation guardian immediately, along with a remediation plan.

The translator and the translation guardian must comply and assist each other in complying with all laws and regulations regarding personal data and privacy protection.

# 8\. Termination

Translators can terminate their service at any time. The translation guardian will continue to manage any completed or in-progress translations.

The translation guardian _may choose to_ terminate a translator If they determine the translator has violated this code of conduct.

The translation guardian must notify the translator(s) of discontinued service in writing at the time of termination.
